# Aptly Automation
- One of the lessons I've learned about using [aptly](https://www.aptly.info/) effectively is that operators should not be touching their aptly server directly.
- Micromanaging mirrors, repositories, and snapshots for multiple environments gets out of hand really quickly.
- This is a collection of shell scripts that I use automate some of the more tedious tasks involving aptly.
